## Party T-shirt ##

## Intent: 
To create a wearable party. 

## Concept ideas: 

1.	A fun party hat. This would include a disco ball attached to the top of the hat. The micro bit will create light up sequences and basically turn the hat into all the lighting equipment needed for a party, as well at making the person wear it look goofy and give everyone a bit of a laugh. 


2.	Arm bands that light up with particular movements. 


3.	Party shoes that play different tunes depending on the type of moment. 


4.	A shirt that plays different songs and lights up with different movements.

From all these concepts I decided that #4 is what I will create and further investigate into. I chose this concept as I felt that it suited and intent the best and was the most practical. The shirt idea means that it can be targeted at any gender, age etc, and it a practical and comfortable piece of clothing that people would usually wear to a party environment. This concept is also very doable considering having access to all the materials needed, as well as having a lot of potential to further develop. This concept will allow not only the person wearing this piece, to be able to interact and engage, but also the people around them.

This brand has created an interactive glow in the dark shirt. This shirt is drawn on with a special digital pen that has a glow output. This project relates to mine, as this shirt is designed to be used in party scenes or in the dark. 

How does this relate/ help with my project? 

-	The use of light really helps portray that party vibe
-	Light sequences – potentially customisable 
-	These shirts are machine washable – how can I make my shirt like this? 
-	Simple t-shirt designs.

ZEROi : Smart Hat with Bone Conduction Technology

This hat uses bone conducting technology to replace the use of earphones and make day to day life more simplified with a hat that plays your music, does phone calls etc. This is all built into a waterproof cap. This project relates to mine as it is using a common piece of clothing and gives it another add on purpose. 

How does this relate/ help with my project? 

-	Simple design 
-	Waterproof -will this be something I need to consider with my design? 
-	Built in invisible components – can achieve this in my design with multiple layers 
-	 Sound close to ears – consider position of the speaker 
-	Works through bone conduction technology – could this be something to consider? 
-	The downside to this hat is that it is extremely expensive and only comes in limited styles. 
-	This hat is also chargeable but does have a small battery life – consider battery life with design.

This product allows for attachable led light strips that use an accelerometer to light up whatever part of your foot hits the ground. The more movement means the more vigorous the lights will flash. 

  How does this relate/ help with my project? 
  
-	Can work with all shapes and sizes of the product – consider different sized clothing 
-	Bright colours and a range of different colours really give off that party vibe
-	Uses an accelerometer- consider this or maybe other sensors?
-	How durable are the led lights – consider the lights available 
-	What sequences could be used and how and when?

## Other research ##
*Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it.*

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

*Provide a link, reference, or whatever is required for somebody else to find the resource. Then provide a few comments about what you have drawn from the resource.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
*Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence.*

### Design concept 1 ###
*Outline three design concepts, each developed to a point where you anticipate it would be feasible to complete by the end of the course. Each should have a summary of the idea, a rough sketch of what it might be like, and any other notes you created while exploring the idea.* 

*Put the first two design concepts in the sections "Design concept 1" and "Design concept 2". Then put the third, with more development in the section "Final design concept".*

### Design concept 2 ###
*Put details here.*

### Final design concept ###
*This more fully developed concept should include consideration of the interaction scheme, technical functionality, fabrication approach, materials to be used, and aesthetic.*

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
