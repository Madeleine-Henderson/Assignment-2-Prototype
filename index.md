This brand has created an interactive glow in the dark shirt. This shirt is drawn on with a special digital pen that has a glow output. This project relates to mine, as this shirt is designed to be used in party scenes or in the dark. 

How does this relate/ help with my project? 

-	The use of light really helps portray that party vibe
-	Light sequences – potentially customisable 
-	These shirts are machine washable – how can I make my shirt like this? 
-	Simple t-shirt designs.

This hat uses bone conducting technology to replace the use of earphones and make day to day life more simplified with a hat that plays your music, does phone calls etc. This is all built into a waterproof cap. This project relates to mine as it is using a common piece of clothing and gives it another add on purpose. 

How does this relate/ help with my project? 

-	Simple design 
-	Waterproof -will this be something I need to consider with my design? 
-	Built in invisible components – can achieve this in my design with multiple layers 
-	 Sound close to ears – consider position of the speaker 
-	Works through bone conduction technology – could this be something to consider? 
-	The downside to this hat is that it is extremely expensive and only comes in limited styles. 
-	This hat is also chargeable but does have a small battery life – consider battery life with design.

This product allows for attachable led light strips that use an accelerometer to light up whatever part of your foot hits the ground. The more movement means the more vigorous the lights will flash. 

  How does this relate/ help with my project? 
  
-	Can work with all shapes and sizes of the product – consider different sized clothing 
-	Bright colours and a range of different colours really give off that party vibe
-	Uses an accelerometer- consider this or maybe other sensors?
-	How durable are the led lights – consider the lights available 
-	What sequences could be used and how and when?

Smart T-shirt with heart rate monitor by AiQ

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45284tobm0c
![Image](missingimage.png) 

This iteam is built into clothing to monitor and provide data on a persons heart rate. This works through connections around the shirt which are then sent to a detachable pin on the shirt which provides a bluetoon signal to send the data to a smart phone. What stood out to me with this design is how it is built into the shirt. There is very minimal wiring/ elements to make this work. What also stood to me is how the pin is detachable and practical to make washing easy etc. These are deffinity things for me to consider when design and building my project. 

 How does this relate/ help with my project? 
  
-	Can work with all shapes and sizes of the product – consider different sized clothing 
-	Bright colours and a range of different colours really give off that party vibe
-	How durable are the connectors in the shirt are they water proof?

Dont Touch: Social Appropriateness of Touch Sensor Placement on Lumalive E-Textile Shirts 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is2mrD0KWjs
![Image](missingimage.png)  

This experiment used sensors places on various parts of the shirt to determine the ideal locations for using sensors on that type of clothing/ part of the body. This is eye opening for me as it allows me to see where ideal places to put touch sensors would be. However the idea im am currently going with doesn’t involve other people touching the shirt, although this is good information to consider when designing and building my project.

This project uses accelerometer sensors to indicate when a driver/user has stopped as well as indicating with turning signals. All of this is done with the use of accelerometer sensors that connect to led lights. This is an interesting project that I will consider during the process of building my design. What stood out to me and relates mostly to my project is the use of those sensors, they will definitely be something to incorporate into my project. 


## Other research ##
### Researching components and functions: 

Accelerometer
-	 measures acceleration range +2g to -2g
-	Works on x and y acsess 

-	Consider how I can use this in regrades to light sequences 
Could use the shake commandment to portray a fast light sequence 


Pin Sensors

Using pins ground 0,1,2 to make a closes circuit that will play different tunes 
-	User will have to press ground sensor to close circuit to allow for Pin 1 or 2 to be pressed. 
-	How will this be laid out? 
-	Could use images on the shirt to indicate sensors 

Sound out put 

Will use ground 0 and pin 1 to hook up the micro bit to a small speaker
-	How will this all be hooked up 
-	Can I do this without using a breadboard to make it less chunky and more practical



### *Brief resource name/description* ###

The micro bit projects
https://microbit.org/projects/
This sight gave me the resources I needed to be able to create this project with a micro bit. I looked at projects relating to the accelerometer sensor as well as touch sensor projects. These allowed me to be more confident I know what to do and how to go about doing it. I also found information on the sight that gave me in sight into how these functions work which was also insightful.

## Conceptual progress ##

 I firstly began with my intent and from there came up with so project concepts, which lead me to the final idea of a party shirt. I came to this conclusion by comparing my ideas and going through the process of elimination. I choose the party shirt as I found it the most realistic and practical item, as well as it still be very interactive for users and the people around them. I considered factors such as comfort, wearability, sustainability, function, intended audience and how well it related to the intent. From considering all those options I found the party shirt to be the most effective and suited project. 

### Design intent ###

To create a wearable party. 

### Design concept 1 ###
1.	A fun party hat. 
This would include a disco ball attached to the top of the hat. The micro bit will create light up sequences and basically turn the hat into all the lighting equipment needed for a party, as well at making the person wear it look goofy and give everyone a bit of a laugh. 

notes:
- is it practical? 
- water proof? 
- would this work with a range of diffrent hat types?

### Design concept 2 ###
2.	Arm bands that light up with particular movements. 
Using LED lights and accelerometer sensors to make the dance floor and baisc movments more fun and interactive. 

notes:
- is this aesthetically pleasing, would it work with peoples fashion taste and outfits?
- dont thing this would really work with the amount of arm movments a person makes especially on a dance floor. 
- the diffrent light patterns wouldnt be clear and would constantly look like flashion lights no matter what the type of movement.

### Design concept 3 ###
3.	Party shoes that play different tunes depending on the type of moment. 
This would work by using accelerometers to retermin the type of movemnt and play a specific tune/ melody.

notes:
- again would this work with the amount of movemnt made especially on a dance floor.
- would this just get really annoying?
- how would this look aesthetically?
- what shoes would this work with? 

### Design concept sketches ###

### Final design concept ###
4.	A shirt that plays different songs and lights up with different movements.

From all these concepts I decided that #4 is what I will create and further investigate into. I chose this concept as I felt that it suited and intent the best and was the most practical. The shirt idea means that it can be targeted at any gender, age etc, and it a practical and comfortable piece of clothing that people would usually wear to a party environment. This concept is also very doable considering having access to all the materials needed, as well as having a lot of potential to further develop. This concept will allow not only the person wearing this piece, to be able to interact and engage, but also the people around them. 

Does this project reflect the intent? 

 Yes, this project has achieved the idea of a “wearable party” allowing for the user to be able to engage with party music and interact with the shirt wherever they go.

# How it will work:

The person wearing the shirt will have multiple options to interact with different functions. If they touch the play button and either one of the other symbols, a melody will play out through the speaker on their back. A range of symbols will also flash on the micro bit. If the person presses button A, the tempo will speed up when playing one of the melodies (this can then be turned off with the reset button on the micro bit). If button B is pressed the micro bit will display any text coded into the micro bit (in this case “maddie Henderson.” If the person wearing the shirt falls over a sad melody will play. If the person is dancing the micro bit will flash a range of different icons.

# materials to be used
Aluminium, electric paint, 2x t-shirts, crocodile clips, micro bit, tape, Velcro strips, a mini speaker.

# Aesthetic: 
This product will maintain a very simple/ minimal design. It will be very contrasting and will stand out as a statement with a diverse range of symbols located around the shirt. It will look very different and unique in that sense.


### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*
